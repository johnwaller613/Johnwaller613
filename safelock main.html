  <p id="terms" style="color: red">since we prioritize safe unbreakable filters, there is no option is take off the filter after its put on. There may be certain modifications to filter polices made later only to specific devices and models and nothing is guaranteed. Do not expect to be able to modify or remove filter later. Again this is for the safety of the filter that we have this policy. </p>
